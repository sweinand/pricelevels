  abstract = {The country-product-dummy (CPD) method, originally proposed in Summers (1973), has recently been revisited in its weighted formulation to handle a variety of data related situations (Rao and Timmer, 2000, 2003; Heravi et al. , 2001; Rao, 2001; Aten and Menezes, 2002; Heston and Aten, 2002; Deaton et al. , 2004). The CPD method is also increasingly being used in the context of hedonic modelling instead of its original purpose of filling holes in Summers (1973). However, the CPD method is seen, among practitioners, as a black box due to its regression formulation. The main objective of the paper is to establish equivalence of purchasing power parities and international prices derived from the application of the weighted-CPD method with those arising out of the Rao-system for multilateral comparisons. A major implication of this result is that the weighted-CPD method would then be a natural method of aggregation at all levels of aggregation within the context of international comparisons.

  abstract = {The paper presents a stochastic approach based on the country-product-dummy (CPD) method for the computation of purchasing power parities (PPPs) in the International Comparison Program. The approach develops estimation strategies in conjunction with the country-product-dummy method to derive a range of multilateral index number methods for the compilation of PPPs at the basic heading level as well as at higher levels of aggregation. At the basic heading level our approach generates Jevons geometric index, arithmetic and harmonic indexes as well as the Dutot index. At higher levels of aggregation, a weighted stochastic model with alternative stochastic specifications and the method of moments (MOM) are used to derive the Geary–Khamis, Iklé, Rao and other multilateral index number methods employed in international comparisons. Expressions for computing standard errors for PPPs based on these formulae are also derived. Existence of solutions to the estimating equations derived from the weighted method of moments or the maximum weighted likelihood is also discussed. A numerical illustration based on ICP 2005 data is presented.},

  abstract = {This study has three main objectives. First, it develops a generalization of the commonly used EKS method to multilateral price comparisons. It is shown that the EKS system can be generalized so that weights can be attached to each of the link comparisons used in the EKS computations. These weights can account for differing levels of reliability of the underlying binary comparisons. Second, various reliability measures and corresponding weighting schemes are presented and their merits discussed. Finally, these new methods are applied to an international data set of manufacturing prices from the ICOP project. Although theoretically superior, it appears that the empirical impact of the weighted EKS method is generally small compared to the unweighted EKS. It is also found that this impact is larger when it is applied at lower levels of aggregation. Finally, the importance of using sector specific PPPs in assessing relative levels of manufacturing productivity is indicated.},

The paper shows that price index numbers from commonly used methods like the Iklé, the Rao-weighted, and an additive multilateral system are all estimators of the parameters of the country-product-dummy (CPD) model. The advantage of the stochastic approach is that we can derive standard errors for the estimates of the purchasing power parities (PPPs). The PPPs and the parameters of the stochastic model are estimated using a weighted maximum likelihood procedure under different stochastic specifications for the disturbance term. Estimates of PPPs and their standard errors for OECD countries using the proposed methods are presented. The paper also outlines a method of moments approach to the estimation of PPPs under the stochastic approach. The paper shows how the Geary-Khamis system of multilateral index numbers is a method of moments estimator of the parameters of the CPD model. The paper therefore provides a coherent stochastic framework for the Geary-Khamis system and derives standard errors of the Geary-Khamis PPPs. Copyright 2010 The Authors.

For the purpose of producing a complete and transitive matrix of ppps, both resort to the EKS procedure, or GEKS, as this paper proposes to rename it. As far as the EUROSTAT procedure is concerned, the formulas for pseudo L and P are analyzed (leaving aside the simple geometric mean suggested by UNSO which gives biased results because of the Gerschenkron effect) and it is shown that the ratios of sums are proper L and P indexes which advantage is that of having a simple and reasonable economic meaning. As for the GEKS iterative procedure, the paper proves that the minimization over the L and P matrices of parities instead of over the matrix of the Fs leads the process to converge in many more cases - therefore giving complete and transitive matrices - than one would obtain through minimization of the matrix of the Fs, which results in a minor loss of information.},

In order to distinguish between various competing multilateral approaches, an axiomatic or test approach to multilateral comparisons is developed.

In this round of the ICP, the world was divided into six regions: OECD, CIS, Africa, South America, Asia Pacific, and West Asia. What is new in this round compared to previous rounds of the ICP is that each region was allowed to develop its own product list and collect prices on this list for countries in the region. The regions were then linked using another separate product list; 18 countries across the six regions collected prices for products on this list and this information was used to link prices and quantities across the regions. An additional complication was that the final linking of prices and volumes across regions had to respect the regional price and volume measures that were (separately) constructed by the regions. The paper also studies the properties of the Iklé–Dikhanov–Balk multilateral system of index numbers which was used by Africa.},
